I remember where I was the very first time
When I heard strawberry wine
It was the middle of the summer that I turned 16
Coulda sworn she was singing that song to me

I can still hear maybe it was Memphis
Rolling through the speakers
When I had my first kiss
Dancing barefoot in the yard
Neath a canopy of trees
To the keeper of the stars
I still get carried away
By the magic, by the moment, never felt that way before
They don't make summers like that no more

Well it crushed my heart when he had to go
My first taste of a walkaway Joe
You don't ever forget it when it cuts that deep
The first time you fall is so bittersweet

I can still hear dust on the bottle
Sitting on the hood of a '02 model Mustang
Sipping on Booze
Getting my first buzz to a neon Moon
I still get carried away by the magic by the moment,
Never felt that way before
They don't make summers like that no more

Oh, a memory can hold onto you so strong
It feels like yesterday, but those days are gone
And time marches on
Time marches on

But I can still hear maybe it was Memphis
Rolling through the speakers
When I had my first kiss
Dancing barefoot in the yard
Neath a canopy of trees
To the keeper of the stars
I still get carried away
By the magic by the moment, never felt that way before
They don't make summers like that no more
No more
