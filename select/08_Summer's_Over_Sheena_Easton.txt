And she walks by the sea
And she's always alone
She knows that it's strange
Staying out in the rain
But there's no one at home

So she kicks up the sand
And stares at the waves
She waits for the sun
And the people who come
With the hot summer days

Easy to remember
In a late september
But nobody told her
That the summer's over

All those hot summer nights
She would sleep on the beach
Nights full of joy
When those young summer boys
Were never far from her reach
